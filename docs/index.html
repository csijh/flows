<h1><span class="key">Flows</span>: A framework for logical web
servers</h1>

<p>There are various frameworks for creating JavaScript web servers, the best
known being <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>. There are two
potential problems with such servers. First, they are based on callbacks, which
can make them difficult to understanding or test. Second, the design of their
components is often obscure, with complex hidden code and many options. This may
be suitable for non-programmers or programmers who don't want to be bothered
with how things work, but is less helpful for serious learners.</p>

<p>A <span class="key">flows</span> web server is built out of components. The
aim is to make it easy to understand, adapt, write, combine and test components.
Here's a quick summary of the conventions for components:</p>

<ul>
<li>a component is a function, usually an <code>async</code> function</li>
<li>it takes <code>request</code> and <code>response</code> objects as arguments</li>
<li>it returns nothing (except a confirmation of completion if <code>async</code>)</li>
<li>it makes changes to the <code>request</code> and <code>response</code> objects</li>
<li>errors cause <code>response.status</code> to be set</li>
<li>most components do nothing if <code>response.status</code> is already set</li>
</ul>

<p>The main differences from express 'middleware' components, for example,
are:</p>

<ul>
<li> there are no callback arguments, making components self-contained and
cleanly composable</li>

<li>components are small, simple and easy to understood or adapt</li>

<li>the entire state of processing is visible on the request and response
objects so that it easy to track</li>

<li>the error conventions almost eliminate the need for
explicit error handling.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Normalizing</h2>

<p>The <code>flows.mjs</code> library contains a <code>normalize</code>
function which validates and normalizes the URL in the request. Here's a
<code>norm.mjs</code> program to try it out without creating a server. It is
assumed that <code>flows.mjs</code> is in the same directory:</p>

<pre>import flows from "./flows.mjs";

let request = { url: "//products/././pets/../dogs.html?x=1&amp;y=2" };
let response = {};

let go = flows.normalize("index.html");
go(request, response);

console.log("request =", request);
console.log("response =", response);
</pre>

<p>The program uses standard JavaScript modules rather than node's own module
conventions, and currently must be run with the
<code>--experimental-modules</code> option:</p>

<pre>&gt; node --experimental-modules norm.mjs
request = { url: '/products/dogs.html', parameters: { x: '1', 'y': '2' } }
reponse = {}
</pre>

<p>The <code>normalize</code> fucntion takes one argument, which is the name of
the default index file in a directory, top be added to a URL ending with the
<code>/</code> character. It returns a component, in this case called
<code>go</code>. The <code>go</code> component is an ordinary function. It is
demonstrated by passing it a request object with a <code>url</code> field which
the component updates. The parameters are taken off the URL, pulled apart and
put into a <code>request.parameters</code> object, and then the URL is tidied up
so that it becomes suitable for use as a file path, for example. In the process,
some basic URL validation is done to guard against security attacks:</p>

<pre>let request = { url: "/products/../../secret.txt" };
...
&gt; node --experimental-modules norm.mjs
request = { url: '/../secret.txt' }
response = { status: 400,
  message: 'Url refers to a file outside of the site' }
</pre>

<p>The validation error is recorded in the response object, which will cause
most other components to be bypassed, until the error is finally delivered back
to the client. The <code>normalize</code> component does not currently do any
translation of encodings such as <code>%20</code>, so only simple plain text
file names without spaces are supported.</p>

<p>In general, components can be tested independently of running a web server,
by looking at their effect on the <code>request</code> and <code>response</code>
objects at each step.</p>

<h2>Reading and writing files</h2>

<p>The <code>read</code> function from <code>flows.mjs</code> can be illustrated
with this <code>read.mjs</code> program:</p>

<pre>import { read } from "./flows.mjs";

let fn = read("a.txt");

async function go(request, response) {
    await fn(request, response);
    console.log(response);
}

go({}, {});
</pre>

<p>This illustrates that items can be imported from <code>flows.mjs</code>
individually, so they can be used without a prefix. The <code>read</code>
function takes one argument, a file path, and returns a component for reading
the file. The component, called <code>fn</code> above, has to be called using
<code>await</code>, because it involves asynchronous I/O, otherwise the response
would be printed out before the file was read in. And the call has to be wrapped
in a function which is marked as <code>async</code>, because it contains
<code>await</code>. The content of the file is stored in
<code>response.data</code>, or appended to it if it already exists.</p>

<p>The <code>read</code> function accepts file paths containing parameters which
refer to fields of the request object. For example,
<code>read("/.files{url}")</code> indicates the <code>request.url</code> should
be appended to <code>./files</code> to form the full file path. This allows
<code>read</code> to use file paths which are partly or wholly calculated during
previous components.</p>

<p>There is a <code>write</code> component which takes a file path and writes
<code>response.data</code> to the given file. It too accepts parameters
representing request fioelds.</p>

<h2>Combining components</h2>

<p>The example program which reads a file can be simplified like this:</p>

<pre>import { chain, read, log } from "./flows.mjs";

let go = chain(read("a.txt"), log);

go({}, {});
</pre>

<p>Components can be combined to make more complex components. The component
<code>go</code> is built by combining two other components in a chain. The
<code>chain</code> function combines any number of components in sequence. The
<code>log</code> component makes testing more convenient by including logging in
the component sequence, avoding the need for explicit use of
<code>await</code>.</p>

<p>When <code>go</code> is called, the effect is to call the components in the
chain one after another, passing the <code>request</code> and
<code>response</code> to each, and waiting for each to finish before calling the
next. The <code>go</code> function above doesn't need to be called with
<code>await</code>, because there is nothing following it which needs to wait
for it to finish.</p>

<h2>Error handling</h2>

<p>Here's an example program <code>cat.mjs</code> which reads in two files,
concatenates them, and writes the result to a third file:</p>

<pre>import { read, write, chain, log } from "./flows.mjs";

let go = chain(read("a.txt"), read("b.txt"), write("c.txt"), log);

go({}, {});
</pre>

<p>If the first file <code>a.txt</code> doesn't exist, the second read and the
write are bypassed, and the error is reported at the end. Most ordinary
components pass on an error rather than taking any action, so that a single
pipeline of components can handle all cases.</p>

<h2>Making choices</h2>

<p>The <code>choose</code> function is used to make decisions:</p>

<pre>import { choose, log } from "./flows.mjs";

let go = choose("/admin/*", log);

go({ url:"/admin/index.html" }, {});
</pre>

<p>If <code>choose</code> is called with two arguments, it acts like an
<code>if...then...</code> statement. If the URL in the request matches the
pattern, then the <code>go</code> component calls the <code>log</code>
component, otherwise the <code>go</code> component does nothing.</p>

<p>If <code>choose</code> is called with three arguments, it acts like an
<code>if...then...else...</code> statement. For example, this component will
execute either <code>c1</code> or <code>c2</code>.</p>

<pre>let go = choose("/admin/*", c1, c2);
</pre>

<p>The <code>choose</code> function can be called with any number of
pattern/component pairs and an optional default component. It acts like a
<code>switch</code> statement, calling the first component whose pattern
matches:</p>

<pre>let go = choose("/admin/*", login, "/do/*", act, display);
</pre>

<p>A URL pattern must contain a single asterisk, representing arbitrary text. It
can thus pick out specific prefixes, or specific suffixes, or both. The pattern
can also be preceded by a request method, e.g. <code>"GET /admin/*"</code>, to
match only requests with that method. The method name can be upper or lower
case.</p>

<h2>Content type</h2>

<p>The <code>type</code> function deals with finding the right content type for
the response. It takes one argument which is a map object with a
<code>getType</code> method. It returns a component that sets the
<code>response.type</code> field. For example:</p>

<pre>import { normalize, log, chain, type } from "./flows.mjs";

let map = { html: "text/html" };
map.getType = function(ext) { return this[ext]; }

let go = chain(normalize, type(map), log);

go({ url: "/products/dogs.html?x=1&amp;y=2" }, {});
</pre>

<p>A map object with a single entry is used to illustrate the function. In a
real web server, an extensive map is usually needed, e.g. by installing the
<code>mime</code> module with <code>npm install mime</code> and importing it
with:</p>

<pre>import map from "mime/lite";
</pre>

<p>The <code>type</code> component does nothing if the
<code>response.type</code> field is already set. If a status other than 200 (OK)
has been set, the error message is used as the response data and the type is set
to <code>"text/plain"</code>. If the type for <code>.html</code> is
<code>"application/xhtml+xml"</code> then content negotiation is used to check
that the type is accepted by the client, otherwise the type is changed to
<code>"text/html"</code>.</p>

<h2>Delivery</h2>

<p>The <code>deliver</code> component sends the response back to the client. To
demonstrate it without building a server, a response object has to be provided
with <code>writeHeader</code>, <code>write</code> and <code>end</code>
methods:</p>

<pre>import { deliver } from "./flows.mjs";

let request = {};
let response = {
    status: 200, data: "xyz", type: "text/plain",
    writeHead, write, end
};
function writeHead(status, head) { console.log("writing head", status, head); }
function write(data) { console.log("writing data", data); }
function end() { console.log("sending response"); }

deliver(request, response);
</pre>

<h2>A complete server</h2>

<p>A complete static server can be defined using the components described so
far:</p>

<pre>import http from "http";
import map from "mime/lite";
import { chain, normalize, read, type, deliver, log } from "./flows.mjs";

let handle = chain(
    normalize("index.html"),
    read("./files{url}"),
    type(map),
    deliver
);

let service = http.createServer(handle);
service.listen(8080, "localhost");
</pre>

<h2>Future components</h2>

<p>These could include components to:</p>

<ul>

<li>read the body of a post request</li>

<li>interpret the body of a post request as parameters</li>

<li>read the body of a put request, and store it as a file</li>

<li>tell the browser to redirect</li>

<li>use cookies to manage sessions, redirecting to a login page if necessary</li>

<li>check authorisation.</li>

<li>rewrite the url so that the first part becmoes a template page and later
parts become parameters</li>

<li>arrange to call a specific handler</li>

<li>treat one part of a url as a handler name, and pass control to that
handler</li>

<li>set a header on the response</li>

<li>read data from a database</li>

<li>update a database</li>

</ul>
<!--
Three types of URL.
A: static file, easy default.
B: /do/handler?params anything not seen by user
C: /product/pet/dog/fido.html [URL rewriting?]
       define templates after prefixes
       templates give meaning to position params ($1 = dog, $2 = fido)
       templates specify what db queries to make
