# Flows
This is a small experimental JavaScript web server framework. The idea is to
investigate the extent to which the `async` and `await` keywords can simplify
the design.

There is no large ecosystem of useful components, and no attempt has been made
to ensure efficiency for a high volume of traffic, so *flows* cannot compete
with existing frameworks. However, it might be attractive for programmers who
want to understand how things work or have complete control. The *flows*
framework consists of a single module and a minimal manual:

- [flows.mjs](//raw.githubusercontent.com/csijh/flows/master/flows.mjs)
- [documentation](//csijh.github.io/flows/)
